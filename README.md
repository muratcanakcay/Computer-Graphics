# Computer-Graphics
My work in C# for the 6th Semester "Computer Graphics" class in the Computer Science B.S. program at Politechnika Warszawa.

# Lab 2 - Image Filtering, Dithering and Color Quantization
(Includes all work from Lab1)  
Image processing algorithms such as inversion, brightness, blur, sharpen as wekk as color quantization using K-means algorithm.

# Lab 4 - Rasterization, Filling and Clipping
(Includes all work from Lab3)  
Implementation of line and circle drawing algorithms. Filling a polygon with a texture. Using a rectangle as a clipping rectangle.
